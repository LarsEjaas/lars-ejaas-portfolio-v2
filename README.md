## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you fork this repo - please read!

I‚Äôm dedicated to keeping this project open-source, mainly as a source of inspiration for other developers looking to build their own personal websites.
<br />

That said, I‚Äôve put significant time and effort into designing and developing this version of the site, and I‚Äôm proud of the outcome. I kindly ask that you don‚Äôt claim my work as your own.
<br />

Please also note that this repository is not intended to be an Astro starter theme. If you need assistance with Astro, I recommend checking out their [documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). It's great!
<br />

**To summarize:**  
Yes, feel free to fork this repository for inspiration!
Just be sure to create your own unique site and credit me by linking back to [larsejaas.com](https://larsejaas.com) if you use any parts of my code.
<br />

Thanks!

## üî• Motivation

My first version of this site was built with¬†[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)¬†and went live back in May 2021.
React was all new to me, I had no idea about TypeScript and coding was a fun hobby.

Fast-forward to today, and I've come a long way since then. Working professionally as a developer, I've been able to build a lot of cool projects and learn a lot of new things.

As I usually work in React frameworks, I decided it could be a fun challenge to build a site using Astro without any React and without any CSS frameworks.

<p align="right"><<a href="#top">back to top‚¨ÜÔ∏è</a>></p>

## üíª Getting started

Start by cloning the repository to your local development environment and cd into the project.
There really isn't much more to it than that. No, JavaScript frameworks, no CSS frameworks, and limited use of TypeScript/JavaScript.

## üéØ Project objectives

- Exploring Astro (I've heard great things about this framework but never used it before).
- Exploring new CSS features like: [**CSS container queries**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries), [**CSS nesting**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting), the [**light-dark**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) CSS color function, [**animation-timeline**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline), [**Cascade layers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) and last, but not least, the [**view transitions API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).
- Diving a bit deeper into accessibility and getting more time with a screen reader.
- Creating a progressive enhanced page that is fully functional when JavaScript is disabled/unavailable.
- Sticking to my previous design and color-scheme, but with a few tweaks and improvements in the areas I felt needed a face-lift.
- Making the site targeted towards my professional career with a bit about me and my background.

Thank you to the following developers - their content has been an inspiration when creating the site:

|    _Jhey Tompkins_    | Jhey is generally a huge inspiration when it comes to diving into all the latest CSS features. His [Infinite Marquee](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/RwdPvvz) Codepen inspired me to create a refactored overview of my development skills using CSS animations. Check out his page at [jhey.dev](https://jhey.dev/)                                                                  |
|     _Adam Argyle_     | Adams the man to follow for guides and updates on new CSS features and inspiration on how to implement these in your code. His [Responsive app switcher carousel](https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/MWMQJQy) on CodePen was an inspiration to tweak my existing carousel implementation featuring scroll-timeline animations. Check out his page at [nerdy.dev](https://nerdy.dev/) |
| _Kirupa Chinnathambi_ | I got inspired by a forum post by Kirupa for animating the floating balloons on my page with a combination of CSS and JavaScript. I previously used the GSAP JavaScript animation library, but wanted to replace it with something lighter. Check out his page at [kirupa.com](https://www.kirupa.com/)                                                                            |

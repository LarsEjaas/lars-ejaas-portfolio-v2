## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you fork this repo - please read!

I'm dedicated to keeping this project open-source, mainly as a source of inspiration for other developers looking to build their own personal websites. However, I've invested significant time and effort into designing and developing this version of the site, and I'm proud of the outcome.
<br />
<br />
**Please note:**

- Do not claim this work as your own.
- This repository is not intended to be an Astro starter theme.
- If you need assistance with Astro, please refer to their [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
  <br />

**To summarize:** Feel free to fork this repository for inspiration on creating your own portfolio! Just be sure to create your own unique site and credit me by linking back to [larsejaas.com](https://larsejaas.com) if you directly re-use parts of my code.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for understanding and respecting my work!

## üî• Motivation

My journey with this site began in May 2021 when I launched the first version built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). At that time, React was new to me, I had no idea about TypeScript, and coding was a fun hobby.
<br />
<br />
Fast-forward to today, and I've grown significantly as a developer.
Working professionally in the field has allowed me to build numerous exciting projects and expand my knowledge base.
<br />
<br />
While I typically would choose to build a bage like with a React framework like Nextjs, I decided to challenge myself by building this site using Astro without any JavaScript framework and without any CSS framework either.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites & Requirements

- [x] Node.js (v21 or higher)
- [x] npm
- [x] Git
- [x] A Gmail account for SMTP services
- [x] Netlify CLI (making it possible to debug serverless functions locally).
  - Install the Netlify CLI globally: `npm install -g netlify-cli`

## üîå Recommended VS Code Extensions

- [x] **Astro** - [vscode:extension/astro-build.astro-vscode](vscode:extension/astro-build.astro-vscode)
- [x] **Prettier Code Formatter** - [vscode:extension/esbenp.prettier-vscode](vscode:extension/esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [x] **ESLint** - [vscode:extension/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](vscode:extension/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

- [x] **SVG** - [vscode:extension/jock.svg](vscode:extension/jock.svg)

## üíª Getting started

Clone the repository to your local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarsEjaas/lars-ejaas-portfolio-v2.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd lars-ejaas-portfolio-v2
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create an `.env` file in the root directory and inspect the `.env.example` file in the root of the project for the required environment variables.

Install the pre-commit hook (you can skip this step if you do not plan to commit code):

```bash
npx husky install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
netlify dev
```

That's it!

The project is intentionally simple, with no JavaScript frameworks, no CSS frameworks, and limited use of JavaScript in the browser.

## üéØ Project objectives

- Explore Astro, a framework I've heard great things about but never used before.
- Implement and experiment with new CSS features, including:
  - [**CSS container queries**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries)
  - [**CSS nesting**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting)
  - The [**light-dark**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) CSS color function
  - [**animation-timeline**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline)
  - [**Cascade layers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers)
  - [**View Transitions API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
  - [**Popover API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
- Enhance accessibility and gain more experience with screen readers.
- Create a progressively enhanced page that functions fully when JavaScript is disabled or unavailable.
- Maintain the previous design and color scheme while improving areas that needed a face-lift.
- Focus the site on my professional career - but also include a bit about myself and my sports background.

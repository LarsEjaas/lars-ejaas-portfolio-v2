## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you fork this repo - please read!

I'm dedicated to keeping this project open-source, mainly as a source of inspiration for other developers looking to build their own personal websites. However, I've invested significant time and effort into designing and developing this version of the site, and I'm proud of the outcome.
<br />
<br />
**Please note:**

- Do not claim this work as your own.
- This repository is not intended to be an Astro starter theme.
- If you need assistance with Astro, please refer to their [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
  <br />

**To summarize:** Feel free to fork this repository for inspiration! Just be sure to create your own unique site and credit me by linking back to [larsejaas.com](https://larsejaas.com) if you use any parts of my code.

## üî• Motivation

My journey with this site began in May 2021 when I launched the first version built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). At that time, React was new to me, I had no idea about TypeScript, and coding was a fun hobby.
<br />
<br />
Fast-forward to today, and I've grown significantly as a developer.
Working professionally in the field has allowed me to build numerous exciting projects and expand my knowledge base.
<br />
<br />
While I typically work with React frameworks, I decided to challenge myself by building this site using Astro without React and without any CSS frameworks.

## üíª Getting started

Clone the repository to your local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarsEjaas/lars-ejaas-portfolio-v2.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd lars-ejaas-portfolio-v2
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it!

The project is intentionally simple, with no JavaScript frameworks, no CSS frameworks, and limited use of TypeScript/JavaScript.

  - [**CSS container queries**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries)
  - [**CSS nesting**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting)
  - The [**light-dark**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) CSS color function
  - [**animation-timeline**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline)
  - [**Cascade layers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers)

  - [**Popover API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
- Enhance accessibility and gain more experience with screen readers.
- Create a progressively enhanced page that functions fully when JavaScript is disabled or unavailable..
- Maintain the previous design and color scheme while improving areas that needed a face-lift.
- Focus the site on my professional career - but also include a bit about myself and my sports background.
